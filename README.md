# ⚔️ Battle Arena Game — Java OOP Project

A simple turn-based battle game built in Java to practice OOP concepts like Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Constructors, and basic encapsulation behavior.

The player selects a hero class — Warrior, Mage, or Archer — and battles an enemy Goblin until one of them falls.

**🎮 Game Overview**

🗡️ Warrior — High HP, steady attack

Turn-based combat:

Hero attacks → Enemy takes damage

Enemy attacks → Hero takes damage

Game ends when:

Hero wins

Enemy wins

Double KO (both die same turn)
